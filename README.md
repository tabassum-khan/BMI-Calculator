# BMI Calculator

A basic web project that calculates BMI(Body Mass Index) of a person using the metric units, that is, weight(in kgs) and height(in metres).
**Input:**

  - Height (in feet and inches)

## BMI - Body Mass Index
**Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.**

> Formula:
> 
> **BMI = weight** (in kgs) **/ (height*height)** (in m)

If your BMI is: 
  - below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range. Represented in yellow.
  - between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range. Represented in blue.
  - between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range. Represented in orange.
